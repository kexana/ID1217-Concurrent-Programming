*ID1217 VT25 Concurrent Programming at KTH during ICT bsc*

***

This course covers the core concepts and techniques for concurrent (process-oriented and multithreaded) programming. This forms the basis for operating systems, reactive and real-time systems and distributed and multi-processor systems. It also provides an overview of principles of distributed and parallel programming. The course is intended to provide knowledge and skills in process-oriented programming.

These assigments are written as part of group tasks by me and my teammate Kacper Lisik. 
From the given choice between Java and C we decided to work on them with the latter.

## Folder Structure

Each homework assigment folder contains the following files by default, where:

- `SourceCode`: the folder to maintain sources for the task
- `Report.tex`: the assigment report in \Latex code
- `Report.pdf`: the finished report as a pdf
